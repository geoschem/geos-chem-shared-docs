From the abstract of Xu et al. [2019]:

   Trace metal distributions are of relevance to understand sources of
   fine particulate matter (PM2.5), PM2.5-related health effects, and
   atmospheric chemistry. However, knowledge of trace metal distributions
   is lacking due to limited ground-based measurements and model
   simulations. This study develops a simulation of 12 trace metal
   concentrations (Si, Ca, Al, Fe, Ti, Mn, K, Mg, As, Cd, Ni and Pb)
   over continental North America for 2013 using the GEOS-Chem
   chemical transport model. Evaluation of modeled trace metal
   concentrations with observations indicates a spatial consistency
   within a factor of 2. The spatial distribution of trace metal
   concentrations reflects their primary emission sources. Crustal
   element (Si, Ca, Al, Fe, Ti, Mn, K) concentrations are enhanced
   over the central US from anthropogenic fugitive dust and over the
   southwestern U.S. due to natural mineral dust. Heavy metal (As, Cd,
   Ni and Pb) concentrations are high over the eastern U.S. from
   industry. K is abundant in the southeast from biomass burning. High
   concentrations of Mg are observed along the coast from sea
   spray. The spatial pattern of PM2.5 mass is most strongly
   correlated with Pb, Ni, As and K due to their signature emission
   sources. Challenges remain in accurately simulating observed trace
   metal concentrations. Halving anthropogenic fugitive dust emissions
   in the 2011 National Air Toxic Assessment (NATA) inventory and
   doubling natural dust emissions in the default GEOS-Chem simulation
   was necessary to reduce biases in crustal element concentrations. A
   fivefold increase of anthropogenic emissions of As and Pb was
   necessary in the NATA inventory to reduce the national-scale bias
   versus observations by more than 80%, potentially reflecting
   missing sources.
