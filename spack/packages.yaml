# DESCRIPTION   This file has recommended package settings for
#               GEOS-Chem/GCHP/HEMCO dependencies. It is meant to be
#               as a custom scope for spack.
#
# HOW TO UPGRADE
#   1. Update package.<package-name>.version to the appropriate version number
#   2. Check for changes to the variants by running
#      `spack info <package-name>@<version>`. Only the
#      required extensions should be enabled.
#   3. Verify install spec with updated geoschem-deps/package.yaml by running
#        spack -C ${model}/spack spec -I esmf^gcc^openmpi
#      where ${model} is one of "GCClassic", "GCHP", "HEMCO".
#      Check for duplicate installs (same package different hash)
#      and unnecessary dependencies.
