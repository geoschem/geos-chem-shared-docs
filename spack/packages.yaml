# DESCRIPTION   This file has recommended package settings for GCHP dependencies. It is meant to be
#               used by including GCHP/spack as a custom scope for spack.
#
# HOW TO UPGRADE
#   1. Update pacakge.<package-name>.version to the appropriate version number
#   2. Check for changes to the variants by running `spack info <package-name>@<version>`. Only the
#      required extensions should be enabled.
#   3. Verify install spec with updated geoschem-deps/package.yaml by running 
#        spack -C GCHP/spack spec -I esmf%intel ^intel-oneapi-mpi
#        spack -C GCHP/spack spec -I esmf%intel ^openmpi
#      Check for duplicate installs (same package different hash) and unnecessary dependencies.
